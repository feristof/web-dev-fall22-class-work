What your computer experience has been so far. Include any interesting projects that you've worked on or interesting courses you've taken?
**-->** Senior here, and the CS courses I've taken so far have been fantastic. I got hands on with great concepts, softwares and programming languages during my courses. My best project and one of the most interesting project I worked on was to create a shopping website that runs on a local host, we used bunch of languages like PHP, CSS3, JS, HTML5 and softwares. My fav. courses were Software engineering, OOP, Operating System and Into to Web Prog(CS3)

Where do you see yourself using what you learn in this course?
**-->** I'll be able to focus on the core concepts that are crucial for web dev and get experience in  JS environment/framework(Node, Vue) and database programs(MongoDB...) and more to become a better and skillful full stack developer
