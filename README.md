What your computer experience has been so far. Include any interesting projects that you've worked on or interesting courses you've taken?
**-->** I am senior and its been a great experience with the CS courses I have took so far. I got hands on with great concepts, softwares and programming languages. My best project and most interesting project I worked on creating a shopping website running on a local host in my Software Engineering course, we used bunch of languages like PHP, CSS3, JS, HTML5.

Where do you see yourself using what you learn in this course?
**-->** I will be able to focus on my core concepts that are essential for web dev and get more hands on with JS environment/framework(Node, Vue) and database programs(MongoDB...) and more to become a better and skillful full stack developer
